The latest update of this document, as an archived, [bzip2-ed](filearchiv.html#BZIPREF) "tarball" including both the SGML source and rendered HTML, may be downloaded from the [author's home site](http://bash.deta.in/abs-guide-latest.tar.bz2)). A [pdf version](http://bash.deta.in/abs-guide.pdf) is also available ([mirror site](http://www.mediafire.com/file/xi34ape1bifcnlb/abs-guide.pdf)). There is likewise an [epub version](http://bash.deta.in/abs-guide.epub), courtesy of Craig Barnes and Michael Satke. The [change log](http://bash.deta.in/Change.log) gives a detailed revision history. The _ABS Guide_ even has [its own freshmeat.net/freecode page](http://freecode.com/projects/advancedbashscriptingguide/) to keep track of major updates, user comments, and popularity ratings for the project.

The legacy hosting site for this document is the [Linux Documentation Project](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/), which maintains many other Guides and HOWTOs as well.

Many thanks to Ronny Bangsund for donating [server space](http://bash.deta.in/) to host this project.
