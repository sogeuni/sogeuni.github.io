title: Appendix A. Contributed Scripts
---


These scripts, while not fitting into the text of this document, do illustrate some interesting shell programming techniques. Some are useful, too. Have fun analyzing and running them.

**Example A-1.** *mailformat*: Formatting an e-mail message

```bash

#!/bin/bash
# mail-format.sh (ver. 1.1): Format e-mail messages.

# Gets rid of carets, tabs, and also folds excessively long lines.

# =================================================================
#                 Standard Check for Script Argument(s)
ARGS=1
E_BADARGS=85
E_NOFILE=86

if [ $# -ne $ARGS ]  # Correct number of arguments passed to script?
then
  echo "Usage: `basename $0` filename"
  exit $E_BADARGS
fi

if [ -f "$1" ]       # Check if file exists.
then
    file_name=$1
else
    echo "File \"$1\" does not exist."
    exit $E_NOFILE
fi
# -----------------------------------------------------------------

MAXWIDTH=70          # Width to fold excessively long lines to.

# =================================
# A variable can hold a sed script.
# It's a useful technique.
sedscript='s/^>//
s/^  *>//
s/^  *//
s/		*//'
# =================================

#  Delete carets and tabs at beginning of lines,
#+ then fold lines to $MAXWIDTH characters.
sed "$sedscript" $1 | fold -s --width=$MAXWIDTH
                        #  -s option to "fold"
                        #+ breaks lines at whitespace, if possible.


#  This script was inspired by an article in a well-known trade journal
#+ extolling a 164K MS Windows utility with similar functionality.
#
#  An nice set of text processing utilities and an efficient
#+ scripting language provide an alternative to the bloated executables
#+ of a clunky operating system.

exit $?
```

**Example A-2.** *rn*: A simple-minded file renaming utility

This script is a modification of [[Example 16-22|Example 16-22]].

```bash
#! /bin/bash
# rn.sh

# Very simpleminded filename "rename" utility (based on "lowercase.sh").
#
#  The "ren" utility, by Vladimir Lanin (lanin@csd2.nyu.edu),
#+ does a much better job of this.


ARGS=2
E_BADARGS=85
ONE=1                     # For getting singular/plural right (see below).

if [ $# -ne "$ARGS" ]
then
  echo "Usage: `basename $0` old-pattern new-pattern"
  # As in "rn gif jpg", which renames all gif files in working directory to jpg.
  exit $E_BADARGS
fi

number=0                  # Keeps track of how many files actually renamed.


for filename in *$1*      #Traverse all matching files in directory.
do
   if [ -f "$filename" ]  # If finds match...
   then
     fname=`basename $filename`            # Strip off path.
     n=`echo $fname | sed -e "s/$1/$2/"`   # Substitute new for old in filename.
     mv $fname $n                          # Rename.
     let "number += 1"
   fi
done   

if [ "$number" -eq "$ONE" ]                # For correct grammar.
then
 echo "$number file renamed."
else 
 echo "$number files renamed."
fi 

exit $?


# Exercises:
# ---------
# What types of files will this not work on?
# How can this be fixed?
```

**Example A-3.** *blank-rename*: Renames filenames containing blanks

This is an even simpler-minded version of previous script.

```bash
#! /bin/bash
# blank-rename.sh
#
# Substitutes underscores for blanks in all the filenames in a directory.

ONE=1                     # For getting singular/plural right (see below).
number=0                  # Keeps track of how many files actually renamed.
FOUND=0                   # Successful return value.

for filename in *         #Traverse all files in directory.
do
     echo "$filename" | grep -q " "         #  Check whether filename
     if [ $? -eq $FOUND ]                   #+ contains space(s).
     then
       fname=$filename                      # Yes, this filename needs work.
       n=`echo $fname | sed -e "s/ /_/g"`   # Substitute underscore for blank.
       mv "$fname" "$n"                     # Do the actual renaming.
       let "number += 1"
     fi
done   

if [ "$number" -eq "$ONE" ]                 # For correct grammar.
then
 echo "$number file renamed."
else 
 echo "$number files renamed."
fi 

exit 0
```

**Example A-4.** *encryptedpw*: Uploading to an ftp site, using a locally encrypted password

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Example "ex72.sh" modified to use encrypted password.

#  Note that this is still rather insecure,
#+ since the decrypted password is sent in the clear.
#  Use something like "ssh" if this is a concern.

E_BADARGS=85

then
  echo "Usage: `basename $0` filename"
  exit $E_BADARGS
fi  

Username=bozo           # Change to suit.
pword=/home/bozo/secret/password_encrypted.file
# File containing encrypted password.

Filename=`basename $1`  # Strips pathname out of file name.

Server="XXX"
Directory="YYY"         # Change above to actual server name & directory.


Password=`cruft <$pword`          # Decrypt password.
#  Uses the author's own "cruft" file encryption package,
#+ based on the classic "onetime pad" algorithm,
#+ and obtainable from:
#+ Primary-site:   ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/file
#+                 cruft-0.2.tar.gz [16k]


ftp -n $Server <<End-Of-Session
user $Username $Password
binary
bell
cd $Directory
put $Filename
bye
End-Of-Session
# -n option to "ftp" disables auto-logon.
# Note that "bell" rings 'bell' after each file transfer.

exit 0

**Example A-6.** Collatz series

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# collatz.sh

#  The notorious "hailstone" or Collatz series.
#  -------------------------------------------
#  1) Get the integer "seed" from the command-line.
#  2) NUMBER <-- seed
#  3) Print NUMBER.
#  4)  If NUMBER is even, divide by 2, or
#  5)+ if odd, multiply by 3 and add 1.
#  6) NUMBER <-- result 
#  7) Loop back to step 3 (for specified number of iterations).
#
#  The theory is that every such sequence,
#+ no matter how large the initial value,
#+ eventually settles down to repeating "4,2,1..." cycles,
#+ even after fluctuating through a wide range of values.
#
#  This is an instance of an "iterate,"
#+ an operation that feeds its output back into its input.
#  Sometimes the result is a "chaotic" series.

# This is the Bash script version of John Conway's "Game of Life".      #
# "Life" is a simple implementation of cellular automata.               #
# --------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# On a rectangular grid, let each "cell" be either "living" or "dead."  #
# Designate a living cell with a dot, and a dead one with a blank space.#
#      Begin with an arbitrarily drawn dot-and-blank grid,              #
#+     and let this be the starting generation: generation 0.           #
# Determine each successive generation by the following rules:          #
#   1) Each cell has 8 neighbors, the adjoining cells                   #
#+     left, right, top, bottom, and the 4 diagonals.                   #
#                                                                       #

#                       4*5     The * is the cell under consideration.  #

# 2) A living cell with either 2 or 3 living neighbors remains alive.   #
SURVIVE=2                                                               #

#
#
#  Random password generator for Bash 2.x +
#+ by Antek Sawicki <tenox@tenox.tc>,
#+ who generously gave usage permission to the ABS Guide author.
#
# ==> Comments added by document author ==>


MATRIX="0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
# ==> Password will consist of alphanumeric characters.
LENGTH="8"
# ==> May change 'LENGTH' for longer password.


while [ "${n:=1}" -le "$LENGTH" ]
# ==> Recall that := is "default substitution" operator.
# ==> So, if 'n' has not been initialized, set it to 1.
do
	PASS="$PASS${MATRIX:$(($RANDOM%${#MATRIX})):1}"
	# ==> Very clever, but tricky.

	# ==> Starting from the innermost nesting...
	# ==> ${#MATRIX} returns length of array MATRIX.

	# ==> $RANDOM%${#MATRIX} returns random number between 1
	# ==> and [length of MATRIX] - 1.

	# ==> ${MATRIX:$(($RANDOM%${#MATRIX})):1}
	# ==> returns expansion of MATRIX at random position, by length 1. 
	# ==> See {var:pos:len} parameter substitution in Chapter 9.
	# ==> and the associated examples.

	# ==> PASS=... simply pastes this result onto previous PASS (concatenation).

	# ==> To visualize this more clearly, uncomment the following line
	#                 echo "$PASS"
	# ==> to see PASS being built up,
	# ==> one character at a time, each iteration of the loop.

  # make sure /pipe really is a pipe and not a plain file
  rm -rf /pipe
  mkfifo /pipe       # ==> Create a "named pipe", named "/pipe" ...
  
  # ==> 'su xyz' runs commands as user "xyz".

  su xyz -c "ssh $THERE \"cat > /home/xyz/backup/${HERE}-daily.tar.gz\" < /pipe"&
  cd /
  tar -czf - bin boot dev etc home info lib man root sbin share usr var > /pipe
  # ==> Uses named pipe, /pipe, to communicate between processes:
  # ==> 'tar/gzip' writes to /pipe and 'ssh' reads from /pipe.

  # ==> The end result is this backs up the main directories, from / on down.

  # ==>  What are the advantages of a "named pipe" in this situation,
  # ==>+ as opposed to an "anonymous pipe", with |?
  # ==>  Will an anonymous pipe even work here?

  # ==>  Is it necessary to delete the pipe before exiting the script?
  # ==>  How could that be done?

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# tree2.sh

# Lightly modified/reformatted by ABS Guide author.
# Included in ABS Guide with permission of script author (thanks!).

## Recursive file/dirsize checking script, by Patsie
##
## This script builds a list of files/directories and their size (du -akx)
## and processes this list to a human readable tree shape
## The 'du -akx' is only as good as the permissions the owner has.
## So preferably run as root* to get the best results, or use only on
## directories for which you have read permissions. Anything you can't
## read is not in the list.

#* ABS Guide author advises caution when running scripts as root!

# text tokens separated by spans of one or more characters from the
# separator string s2.  The first call (with a non-empty string s1
# specified) echoes a string consisting of the first token on stdout. The
# function keeps track of its position in the string s1 between separate
# calls, so that subsequent calls made with the first argument an empty
# string will work through the string immediately following that token.  In
# this way subsequent calls will work through the string s1 until no tokens
# remain.  The separator string s2 may be different from call to call.
# When no token remains in s1, an empty value is echoed on stdout.

Walk an array of directory fields produced by ListDirectory

Having suppressed the line breaks in an otherwise line oriented
report, build an index to the array element which starts each line.

Each line gets two index entries, the first element of each line
(inode) and the element that holds the pathname of the file.

The first index entry pair (Line-Number==0) are informational:
Index-Array-Name[0] : Number of "Lines" indexed
Index-Array-Name[1] : "Current Line" pointer into Index-Array-Name

The following index pairs (if any) hold element indexes into
the Field-Array-Name per:
Index-Array-Name[Line-Number * 2] : The "inode" field element.
NOTE: This distance may be either +11 or +12 elements.
Index-Array-Name[(Line-Number * 2) + 1] : The "pathname" element.
NOTE: This distance may be a variable number of elements.
Next line index pair for Line-Number+1.

The key (no pun intended) to a Unified Content File System (UCFS)
is to distinguish the files in the system based on their content.
Distinguishing files by their name is just so 20th Century.

The content is distinguished by computing a checksum of that content.
This version uses the md5sum program to generate a 128 bit checksum
representative of the file's contents.
There is a chance that two files having different content might
generate the same checksum using md5sum (or any checksum).  Should
that become a problem, then the use of md5sum can be replace by a
cyrptographic signature.  But until then...

The md5sum program is documented as outputting three fields (and it
does), but when read it appears as two fields (array elements).  This
is caused by the lack of whitespace between the second and third field.
So this function gropes the md5sum output and returns:
	[0]	32 character checksum in hexidecimal (UCFS filename)
	[1]	Single character: ' ' text file, '*' binary file
	[2]	Filesystem (20th Century Style) name
	Note: That name may be the character '-' indicating STDIN read.

St�phane Chazelas demonstrates object-oriented programming in a Bash script.

Mariusz Gniazdowski contributed a [[internal-commands-and-builtins#^HASHREF|hash]] library for use in scripts.

**Example A-20.** Library of hash functions

```bash
# Hash:
# Hash function library
# Author: Mariusz Gniazdowski <mariusz.gn-at-gmail.com>
# Date: 2005-04-07

# Functions making emulating hashes in Bash a little less painful.


#    Limitations:
#  * Only global variables are supported.
#  * Each hash instance generates one global variable per value.
#  * Variable names collisions are possible
#+   if you define variable like __hash__hashname_key
#  * Keys must use chars that can be part of a Bash variable name
#+   (no dashes, periods, etc.).
#  * The hash is created as a variable:
#    ... hashname_keyname
#    So if somone will create hashes like:
#      myhash_ + mykey = myhash__mykey
#      myhash + _mykey = myhash__mykey
#    Then there will be a collision.
#    (This should not pose a major problem.)

Now for a script that installs and mounts those cute USB keychain solid-state "hard drives."

**Example A-23.** Mounting USB keychain storage devices

```bash

# ==> usb.sh
# ==> Script for mounting and installing pen/keychain USB storage devices.
# ==> Runs as root at system startup (see below).
# ==>
# ==> Newer Linux distros (2004 or later) autodetect
# ==> and install USB pen drives, and therefore don't need this script.
# ==> But, it's still instructive.
 
#  This code is free software covered by GNU GPL license version 2 or above.
#  Please refer to http://www.gnu.org/ for the full license text.
#
#  Some code lifted from usb-mount by Michael Hamilton's usb-mount (LGPL)
#+ see http://users.actrix.co.nz/michael/usbmount.html
#
#  INSTALL
#  -------
#  Put this in /etc/hotplug/usb/diskonkey.
#  Then look in /etc/hotplug/usb.distmap, and copy all usb-storage entries
#+ into /etc/hotplug/usb.usermap, substituting "usb-storage" for "diskonkey".
#  Otherwise this code is only run during the kernel module invocation/removal
#+ (at least in my tests), which defeats the purpose.
#
#  TODO
#  ----
#  Handle more than one diskonkey device at one time (e.g. /dev/diskonkey1

#    for example, [image01.jpg].
# 3) Emphasized (italic) phrases begin with a space+underscore
#+   or the first character on the line is an underscore,
#+   and end with an underscore+space or underscore+end-of-line.

    Documentation redirected to the Bash no-operation.
    Bash will '/dev/null' this block when the script is first read.
    (Uncomment the above set command to see this action.)

    Remove the first (Sha-Bang) line when sourcing this as a library
    procedure.  Also comment out the example use code in the two
    places where shown.


    Usage:
        _protect_literal_str 'Whatever string meets your ${fancy}'
        Just echos the argument to standard out, hard quotes
        restored.

        $(_protect_literal_str 'Whatever string meets your ${fancy}')
        as the right-hand-side of an assignment statement.

    Does:
        As the right-hand-side of an assignment, preserves the
        hard quotes protecting the contents of the literal during
        assignment.

    Notes:
        The strange names (_*) are used to avoid trampling on
        the user's chosen names when this is sourced as a
        library.

_Protect_Literal_String_Doc

# The 'for illustration' function form

_protect_literal_str() {

# Pick an un-used, non-printing character as local IFS.
# Not required, but shows that we are ignoring it.
    local IFS=$'\x1B'               # \ESC character

# Enclose the All-Elements-Of in hard quotes during assignment.
    local tmp=$'\x27'$@$'\x27'
#    local tmp=$'\''$@$'\''         # Even uglier.

    local len=${#tmp}               # Info only.
    echo $tmp is $len long.         # Output AND information.
}

# This is the short-named version.
_pls() {
    local IFS=$'x1B'                # \ESC character (not required)
    echo $'\x27'$@$'\x27'           # Hard quoted parameter glob
}

# :<<-'_Protect_Literal_String_Test'
# # # Remove the above "# " to disable this code. # # #

# See how that looks when printed.
echo
echo "- - Test One - -"
_protect_literal_str 'Hello $user'
_protect_literal_str 'Hello "${username}"'
echo

# Which yields:
# - - Test One - -
# 'Hello $user' is 13 long.
# 'Hello "${username}"' is 21 long.

#  Looks as expected, but why all of the trouble?
#  The difference is hidden inside the Bash internal order
#+ of operations.
#  Which shows when you use it on the RHS of an assignment.

# Declare an array for test values.
declare -a arrayZ

# Assign elements with various types of quotes and escapes.
arrayZ=( zero "$(_pls 'Hello ${Me}')" 'Hello ${You}' "\'Pass: ${pw}\'" )

# Now list that array and see what is there.
echo "- - Test Two - -"
for (( i=0 ; i<${#arrayZ[*]} ; i++ ))
do
    echo  Element $i: ${arrayZ[$i]} is: ${#arrayZ[$i]} long.
done
echo

# Which yields:
# - - Test Two - -
# Element 0: zero is: 4 long.           # Our marker element
# Element 1: 'Hello ${Me}' is: 13 long. # Our "$(_pls '...' )"
# Element 2: Hello ${You} is: 12 long.  # Quotes are missing
# Element 3: \'Pass: \' is: 10 long.    # ${pw} expanded to nothing

# Now make an assignment with that result.
declare -a array2=( ${arrayZ[@]} )

# And print what happened.
echo "- - Test Three - -"
for (( i=0 ; i<${#array2[*]} ; i++ ))
do
    echo  Element $i: ${array2[$i]} is: ${#array2[$i]} long.
done
echo

# Which yields:
# - - Test Three - -
# Element 0: zero is: 4 long.           # Our marker element.
# Element 1: Hello ${Me} is: 11 long.   # Intended result.
# Element 2: Hello is: 5 long.          # ${You} expanded to nothing.
# Element 3: 'Pass: is: 6 long.         # Split on the whitespace.
# Element 4: ' is: 1 long.              # The end quote is here now.

#  Our Element 1 has had its leading and trailing hard quotes stripped.
#  Although not shown, leading and trailing whitespace is also stripped.
#  Now that the string contents are set, Bash will always, internally,
#+ hard quote the contents as required during its operations.

#  Why?
#  Considering our "$(_pls 'Hello ${Me}')" construction:
#  " ... " -> Expansion required, strip the quotes.
#  $( ... ) -> Replace with the result of..., strip this.
#  _pls ' ... ' -> called with literal arguments, strip the quotes.
#  The result returned includes hard quotes; BUT the above processing
#+ has already been done, so they become part of the value assigned.
#
#  Similarly, during further usage of the string variable, the ${Me}
#+ is part of the contents (result) and survives any operations
#  (Until explicitly told to evaluate the string).

#  Hint: See what happens when the hard quotes ($'\x27') are replaced
#+ with soft quotes ($'\x22') in the above procedures.
#  Interesting also is to remove the addition of any quoting.

# _Protect_Literal_String_Test
# # # Remove the above "# " to disable this code. # # #

exit 0
```

But, what if you _want_ the shell to expand and reinterpret strings?

Me="to the array guy."

# Set a string variable destination to the result.
newVar=$(_upls ${array2[1]})

# Show what the contents are.
echo $newVar

# Do we really need a function to do this?
newerVar=$(eval echo ${array2[1]})
echo $newerVar

#  I guess not, but the _upls function gives us a place to hang
#+ the documentation on.
#  This helps when we forget what a # construction like:
#+ $(eval echo ... ) means.

# What if Me isn't set when the protected string is evaluated?
unset Me
newestVar=$(_upls ${array2[1]})
echo $newestVar

# Just gone, no hints, no runs, no errors.

#  Why in the world?
#  Setting the contents of a string variable containing character
#+ sequences that have a meaning in Bash is a general problem in
#+ script programming.
#
#  This problem is now solved in eight lines of code
#+ (and four pages of description).

#  Where is all this going?
#  Dynamic content Web pages as an array of Bash strings.
#  Content set per request by a Bash 'eval' command
#+ on the stored page template.
#  Not intended to replace PHP, just an interesting thing to do.
###
#  Don't have a webserver application?
#  No problem, check the example directory of the Bash source;
#+ there is a Bash script for that also.

    Copyright (c) Michael S. Zick, 2004
    License: Unrestricted reuse in any form, for any purpose.
    Warranty: None -{Its a script; the user is on their own.}-

Impatient?
    Application code: goto "# # # Hunt the Spammer' program code # # #"
    Example output: ":<<-'_is_spammer_outputs_'"
    How to use: Enter script name without arguments.
                Or goto "Quickstart" at end of script.

Provides
    Given a domain name or IP(v4) address as input:

    Does an exhaustive set of queries to find the associated
    network resources (short of recursing into TLDs).

    Checks the IP(v4) addresses found against Blacklist
    nameservers.

    If found to be a blacklisted IP(v4) address,
    reports the blacklist text records.
    (Usually hyper-links to the specific report.)

Requires
    A working Internet connection.
    (Exercise: Add check and/or abort if not on-line when running script.)
    Bash with arrays (2.05b+).

    The external program 'dig' --
    a utility program provided with the 'bind' set of programs.
    Specifically, the version which is part of Bind series 9.x
    See: http://www.isc.org

    All usages of 'dig' are limited to wrapper functions,
    which may be rewritten as required.
    See: dig_wrappers.bash for details.
         ("Additional documentation" -- below)

Usage
    Script requires a single argument, which may be:
    1) A domain name;
    2) An IP(v4) address;
    3) A filename, with one name or address per line.

    Script accepts an optional second argument, which may be:
    1) A Blacklist server name;
    2) A filename, with one Blacklist server name per line.

    If the second argument is not provided, the script uses
    a built-in set of (free) Blacklist servers.

    See also, the Quickstart at the end of this script (after 'exit').

Return Codes
    0 - All OK
    1 - Script failure
    2 - Something is Blacklisted

Optional environment variables
    SPAMMER_TRACE
        If set to a writable file,
        script will log an execution flow trace.

    SPAMMER_DATA
        If set to a writable file, script will dump its
        discovered data in the form of GraphViz file.
        See: http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz

    SPAMMER_LIMIT
        Limits the depth of resource tracing.

        Default is 2 levels.

        A setting of 0 (zero) means 'unlimited' . . .
          Caution: script might recurse the whole Internet!

        A limit of 1 or 2 is most useful when processing
        a file of domain names and addresses.
        A higher limit can be useful when hunting spam gangs.

    Add support for IP(v6) addresses.
    IP(v6) addresses are recognized but not processed.

Advanced project
    Add the reverse lookup detail to the discovered information.

    Report the delegation chain and abuse contacts.

    Modify the GraphViz file output to include the
    newly discovered information.

    cat <<-'_usage_statement_'
    The script is_spammer.bash requires either one or two arguments.

    arg 1) May be one of:
        a) A domain name
        b) An IPv4 address
        c) The name of a file with any mix of names
           and addresses, one per line.

    arg 2) May be one of:
        a) A Blacklist server domain name
        b) The name of a file with Blacklist server
           domain names, one per line.
        c) If not present, a default list of (free)
           Blacklist servers is used.
        d) If a filename of an empty, readable, file
           is given,
           Blacklist server lookup is disabled.

    All script output is written to stdout.

    Return codes: 0 -> All OK, 1 -> Script failure,
                  2 -> Something is Blacklisted.

    Requires the external program 'dig' from the 'bind-9'
    set of DNS programs.  See: http://www.isc.org

    The domain name lookup depth limit defaults to 2 levels.
    Set the environment variable SPAMMER_LIMIT to change.
    SPAMMER_LIMIT=0 means 'unlimited'

    Limit may also be set on the command-line.
    If arg#1 is an integer, the limit is set to that value
    and then the above argument rules are applied.

    Setting the environment variable 'SPAMMER_DATA' to a filename
    will cause the script to write a GraphViz graphic file.

    For the development version;
    Setting the environment variable 'SPAMMER_TRACE' to a filename
    will cause the execution engine to log a function call trace.

Quickstart
==========

 Prerequisites

  Bash version 2.05b or 3.00 (bash --version)
  A version of Bash which supports arrays. Array 
  support is included by default Bash configurations.

  'dig,' version 9.x.x (dig $HOSTNAME, see first line of output)
  A version of dig which supports the +short options. 
  See: dig_wrappers.bash for details.


 Optional Prerequisites

  'named,' a local DNS caching program. Any flavor will do.
  Do twice: dig $HOSTNAME 
  Check near bottom of output for: SERVER: 127.0.0.1#53
  That means you have one running.


 Optional Graphics Support

  'date,' a standard *nix thing. (date -R)

  dot Program to convert graphic description file to a 
  diagram. (dot -V)
  A part of the Graph-Viz set of programs.
  See: [http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz|GraphViz]

  'dotty,' a visual editor for graphic description files.
  Also a part of the Graph-Viz set of programs.




 Quick Start

In the same directory as the is_spammer.bash script; 
Do: ./is_spammer.bash

 Usage Details

1. Blacklist server choices.

  (a) To use default, built-in list: Do nothing.

  (b) To use your own list: 

    i. Create a file with a single Blacklist server 
       domain name per line.

    ii. Provide that filename as the last argument to 
        the script.

  (c) To use a single Blacklist server: Last argument 
      to the script.

  (d) To disable Blacklist lookups:

    i. Create an empty file (touch spammer.nul)
       Your choice of filename.

    ii. Provide the filename of that empty file as the 
        last argument to the script.

2. Search depth limit.

  (a) To use the default value of 2: Do nothing.

  (b) To set a different limit: 
      A limit of 0 means: no limit.

    i. export SPAMMER_LIMIT=1
       or whatever limit you want.

    ii. OR provide the desired limit as the first 
       argument to the script.

3. Optional execution trace log.

  (a) To use the default setting of no log output: Do nothing.

  (b) To write an execution trace log:
      export SPAMMER_TRACE=spammer.log
      or whatever filename you want.

4. Optional graphic description file.

  (a) To use the default setting of no graphic file: Do nothing.

  (b) To write a Graph-Viz graphic description file:
      export SPAMMER_DATA=spammer.dot
      or whatever filename you want.

5. Where to start the search.

  (a) Starting with a single domain name:

    i. Without a command-line search limit: First 
       argument to script.

    ii. With a command-line search limit: Second 
        argument to script.

  (b) Starting with a single IP address:

    i. Without a command-line search limit: First 
       argument to script.

    ii. With a command-line search limit: Second 
        argument to script.

  (c) Starting with (mixed) multiple name(s) and/or address(es):
      Create a file with one name or address per line.
      Your choice of filename.

    i. Without a command-line search limit: Filename as 
       first argument to script.

    ii. With a command-line search limit: Filename as 
        second argument to script.

6. What to do with the display output.

  (a) To view display output on screen: Do nothing.

  (b) To save display output to a file: Redirect stdout to a filename.

  (c) To discard display output: Redirect stdout to /dev/null.

7. Temporary end of decision making. 
   press RETURN 
   wait (optionally, watch the dots and colons).

8. Optionally check the return code.

  (a) Return code 0: All OK

  (b) Return code 1: Script setup failure

  (c) Return code 2: Something was blacklisted.

9. Where is my graph (diagram)?

The script does not directly produce a graph (diagram). 
It only produces a graphic description file. You can 
process the graphic descriptor file that was output 
with the 'dot' program.

Until you edit that descriptor file, to describe the 
relationships you want shown, all that you will get is 
a bunch of labeled name and address nodes.

All of the script's discovered relationships are within 
a comment block in the graphic descriptor file, each 
with a descriptive heading.

The editing required to draw a line between a pair of 
nodes from the information in the descriptor file may 
be done with a text editor. 

Given these lines somewhere in the descriptor file:

# Known domain name nodes

N0000 [label="guardproof.info."] ;

N0002 [label="third.guardproof.info."] ;



# Known address nodes

A0000 [label="61.141.32.197"] ;



/*

# Known name->address edges

NA0000 third.guardproof.info. 61.141.32.197



# Known parent->child edges

PC0000 guardproof.info. third.guardproof.info.

 */

Turn that into the following lines by substituting node 
identifiers into the relationships:

# Known domain name nodes

N0000 [label="guardproof.info."] ;

N0002 [label="third.guardproof.info."] ;



# Known address nodes

A0000 [label="61.141.32.197"] ;



# PC0000 guardproof.info. third.guardproof.info.

N0000->N0002 ;



# NA0000 third.guardproof.info. 61.141.32.197

N0002->A0000 ;



/*

# Known name->address edges

NA0000 third.guardproof.info. 61.141.32.197



# Known parent->child edges

PC0000 guardproof.info. third.guardproof.info.

 */

Process that with the 'dot' program, and you have your 
first network diagram.

In addition to the conventional graphic edges, the 
descriptor file includes similar format pair-data that 
describes services, zone records (sub-graphs?), 
blacklisted addresses, and other things which might be 
interesting to include in your graph. This additional 
information could be displayed as different node 
shapes, colors, line sizes, etc.

The descriptor file can also be read and edited by a 
Bash script (of course). You should be able to find 
most of the functions required within the 
"is_spammer.bash" script.

**Example A-32.** Nightly backup to a firewire HD

```bash

# http://www.richardneill.org/source.php#nightly-backup-rsync
# Copyright (c) 2005 Richard Neill <backup@richardneill.org>.
# This is Free Software licensed under the GNU GPL.
# ==> Included in ABS Guide with script author's kind permission.
# ==> (Thanks!)

#  This does a backup from the host computer to a locally connected
#+ firewire HDD using rsync and ssh.
#  (Script should work with USB-connected device (see lines 40-43).
#  It then rotates the backups.
#  Run it via cron every night at 5am.
#  This only backs up the home directory.
#  If ownerships (other than the user's) should be preserved,
#+ then run the rsync process as root (and re-instate the -o).
#  We save every day for 7 days, then every week for 4 weeks,
#+ then every month for 3 months.

#  See: http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/
#+ for more explanation of the theory.
#  Save as: $HOME/bin/nightly-backup_firewire-hdd.sh

#  Known bugs:
#  ----------
#  i)  Ideally, we want to exclude ~/.tmp and the browser caches.

#  ii) If the user is sitting at the computer at 5am,
#+     and files are modified while the rsync is occurring,
#+     then the BACKUP_JUSTINCASE branch gets triggered.
#      To some extent, this is a 
#+     feature, but it also causes a "disk-space leak".

#       .cd_new
#
#       An enhancement of the Unix cd command
#
#       There are unlimited stack entries and special entries. The stack
#       entries keep the last cd_maxhistory
#       directories that have been used. The special entries can be
#       assigned to commonly used directories.
#
#       The special entries may be pre-assigned by setting the environment
#       variables CDSn or by using the -u or -U command.
#
#       The following is a suggestion for the .profile file:
#
#               . cdll              #  Set up the cd command
#       alias cd='cd_new'           #  Replace the cd command
#               cd -U               #  Upload pre-assigned entries for
#                                   #+ the stack and special entries
#               cd -D               #  Set non-default mode
#               alias @="cd_new @"  #  Allow @ to be used to get history
#
#       For help type:

    *The special entries (0 - 9) are held until log off, replaced by another
     entry or updated with the -u command

    Alternative suggested directories:
    If a directory is not found then CD will suggest any
    possibilities. These are directories starting with the same letters
    and if any are found they are listed prefixed with -a<n>
    where <n> is a number.
    It's possible to go to the directory by entering cd -a<n>
    on the command line.
    
    The directory for -r<n> or -R<n> may be a number.
    For example:
        $ cd -r3 4  Go to history entry 4 and put it on special entry 3
        $ cd -R3 4  Put current dir on the special entry 3
                    and go to history entry 4
        $ cd -s3    Go to special entry 3
    
    Note that commands R,r,S and s may be used without a number
    and refer to 0:
        $ cd -s     Go to special entry 0
        $ cd -S     Go to special entry 0 and make special
                    entry 0 current dir
        $ cd -r 1   Go to history entry 1 and put it on special entry 0
        $ cd -r     Go to history entry 0 and put it on special entry 0

=======================================================================

cdll is a replacement for cd and incorporates similar functionality to
the bash pushd and popd commands but is independent of them.

This version of cdll has been tested on Linux using Bash. It will work
on most Linux versions but will probably not work on other shells without
modification.

Introduction
============

cdll allows easy moving about between directories. When changing to a new
directory the current one is automatically put onto a stack. By default
50 entries are kept, but this is configurable. Special directories can be
kept for easy access - by default up to 10, but this is configurable. The
most recent stack entries and the special entries can be easily viewed.

The directory stack and special entries can be saved to, and loaded from,
a file. This allows them to be set up on login, saved before logging out
or changed when moving project to project.

In addition, cdll provides a flexible command prompt facility that allows,
for example, a directory name in colour that is truncated from the left
if it gets too long.


Setting up cdll
===============

Copy cdll to either your local home directory or a central directory
such as /usr/bin (this will require root access).

Copy the file cdfile to your home directory. It will require read and
write access. This a default file that contains a directory stack and
special entries.

To replace the cd command you must add commands to your login script.
The login script is one or more of:

    /etc/profile
    ~/.bash_profile
    ~/.bash_login
    ~/.profile
    ~/.bashrc
    /etc/bash.bashrc.local
    
To setup your login, ~/.bashrc is recommended, for global (and root) setup
add the commands to /etc/bash.bashrc.local
    
To set up on login, add the command:
    . <dir>/cdll
For example if cdll is in your local home directory:
    . ~/cdll
If in /usr/bin then:
    . /usr/bin/cdll

If you want to use this instead of the buitin cd command then add:
    alias cd='cd_new'
We would also recommend the following commands:
    alias @='cd_new @'
    cd -U
    cd -D

If you want to use cdll's prompt facilty then add the following:
    CDL_PROMPTLEN=nn
Where nn is a number described below. Initially 99 would be suitable
number.

Thus the script looks something like this:

    ######################################################################
    # CD Setup
    ######################################################################
    CDL_PROMPTLEN=21        # Allow a prompt length of up to 21 characters
    . /usr/bin/cdll         # Initialise cdll
    alias cd='cd_new'       # Replace the built in cd command
    alias @='cd_new @'      # Allow @ at the prompt to display history
    cd -U                   # Upload directories
    cd -D                   # Set default action to non-posix
    ######################################################################

The full meaning of these commands will become clear later.

There are a couple of caveats. If another program changes the directory
without calling cdll, then the directory won't be put on the stack and
also if the prompt facility is used then this will not be updated. Two
programs that can do this are pushd and popd. To update the prompt and
stack simply enter:

    cd .
    
Note that if the previous entry on the stack is the current directory
then the stack is not updated.

Usage
=====  
cd [dir] [0-9] [@[s|h] [-g <dir>] [-d] [-D] [-r<n>]
   [dir|0-9] [-R<n>] [<dir>|0-9] [-s<n>] [-S<n>]
   [-u] [-U] [-f] [-F] [-h] [-H] [-v]

    <dir>       Go to directory
    0-n         Goto previous directory (0 is previous,
                1 is last but 1, etc.)
                n is up to max history (default is 50)
    @           List history and special entries (Usually available as $ @)
    @h          List history entries
    @s          List special entries
    -g [<dir>]  Go to literal name (bypass special names)
                This is to allow access to dirs called '0','1','-h' etc
    -d          Change default action - verbose. (See note)
    -D          Change default action - silent. (See note)
    -s<n>       Go to the special entry <n>
    -S<n>       Go to the special entry <n>
                      and replace it with the current dir
    -r<n> [<dir>] Go to directory <dir>
                              and then put it on special entry <n>
    -R<n> [<dir>] Go to directory <dir>
                              and put current dir on special entry <n>
    -a<n>       Alternative suggested directory. See note below.
    -f [<file>] File entries to <file>.
    -u [<file>] Update entries from <file>.
                If no filename supplied then default file (~/cdfile) is used
                -F and -U are silent versions
    -v          Print version number
    -h          Help
    -H          Detailed help



Examples
========

These examples assume non-default mode is set (that is, cd with no
parameters will go to the most recent stack directory), that aliases
have been set up for cd and @ as described above and that cd's prompt
facility is active and the prompt length is 21 characters.

    /home/phil$ @
    # List the entries with the @
    History:
    # Output of the @ command
    .....
    # Skipped these entries for brevity
    1 /home/phil/ummdev               S1 /home/phil/perl
    # Most recent two history entries
    0 /home/phil/perl/eg              S0 /home/phil/umm/ummdev
    # and two special entries are shown
    
    /home/phil$ cd /home/phil/utils/Cdll
    # Now change directories
    /home/phil/utils/Cdll$ @
    # Prompt reflects the directory.
    History:
    # New history
    .....   
    1 /home/phil/perl/eg              S1 /home/phil/perl
    # History entry 0 has moved to 1
    0 /home/phil                      S0 /home/phil/umm/ummdev
    # and the most recent has entered
       
To go to a history entry:

    /home/phil/utils/Cdll$ cd 1
    # Go to history entry 1.
    /home/phil/perl/eg$
    # Current directory is now what was 1
    
To go to a special entry:

    /home/phil/perl/eg$ cd -s1
    # Go to special entry 1
    /home/phil/umm/ummdev$
    # Current directory is S1

To go to a directory called, for example, 1:

    /home/phil$ cd -g 1
    # -g ignores the special meaning of 1
    /home/phil/1$
    
To put current directory on the special list as S1:
    cd -r1 .        #  OR
    cd -R1 .        #  These have the same effect if the directory is
                    #+ . (the current directory)

To go to a directory and add it as a special  
  The directory for -r<n> or -R<n> may be a number.
  For example:
        $ cd -r3 4  Go to history entry 4 and put it on special entry 3
        $ cd -R3 4  Put current dir on the special entry 3 and go to
                    history entry 4
        $ cd -s3    Go to special entry 3

    Note that commands R,r,S and s may be used without a number and
    refer to 0:
        $ cd -s     Go to special entry 0
        $ cd -S     Go to special entry 0 and make special entry 0
                    current dir
        $ cd -r 1   Go to history entry 1 and put it on special entry 0
        $ cd -r     Go to history entry 0 and put it on special entry 0


    Alternative suggested directories:

    If a directory is not found, then CD will suggest any
    possibilities. These are directories starting with the same letters
    and if any are found they are listed prefixed with -a<n>
    where <n> is a number. It's possible to go to the directory
    by entering cd -a<n> on the command line.

        Use cd -d or -D to change default cd action. cd -H will show
        current action.

        The history entries (0-n) are stored in the environment variables
        CD[0] - CD[n]
        Similarly the special directories S0 - 9 are in the environment
        variable CDS[0] - CDS[9]
        and may be accessed from the command line, for example:
        
            ls -l ${CDS[3]}
            cat ${CD[8]}/file.txt

        The default pathname for the -f and -u commands is ~
        The default filename for the -f and -u commands is cdfile


Configuration
=============

    The following environment variables can be set:
    
        CDL_PROMPTLEN  - Set to the length of prompt you require.
            Prompt string is set to the right characters of the current
            directory. If not set, then prompt is left unchanged. Note
            that this is the number of characters that the directory is
            shortened to, not the total characters in the prompt.

            CDL_PROMPT_PRE - Set to the string to prefix the prompt.
                Default is:
                    non-root:  "\\[\\e[01;34m\\]"  (sets colour to blue).
                    root:      "\\[\\e[01;31m\\]"  (sets colour to red).

            CDL_PROMPT_POST    - Set to the string to suffix the prompt.
                Default is:
                    non-root:  "\\[\\e[00m\\]$"
                               (resets colour and displays $).
                    root:      "\\[\\e[00m\\]#"
                               (resets colour and displays #).

        Note:
            CDL_PROMPT_PRE & _POST only t

        CDPath - Set the default path for the -f & -u options.
                 Default is home directory
        CDFile - Set the default filename for the -f & -u options.
                 Default is cdfile


    There are three variables defined in the file cdll which control the
    number of entries stored or displayed. They are in the section labeled
    'Initialisation here' towards the end of the file.

        cd_maxhistory       - The number of history entries stored.
                              Default is 50.
        cd_maxspecial       - The number of special entries allowed.
                              Default is 9.

DOCUMENTATION
```

**Example A-34.** A soundcard setup script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# soundcard-on.sh

#  Script author: Mkarcher
#  http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki  ...
#  /Script_for_configuring_the_CS4239_sound_chip_in_PnP_mode
#  ABS Guide author made minor changes and added comments.
#  Couldn't contact script author to ask for permission to use, but ...
#+ the script was released under the FDL,
#+ so its use here should be both legal and ethical.

#  Sound-via-pnp-script for Thinkpad 600E
#+ and possibly other computers with onboard CS4239/CS4610
#+ that do not work with the PCI driver
#+ and are not recognized by the PnP code of snd-cs4236.
#  Also for some 770-series Thinkpads, such as the 770x.
#  Run as root user, of course.
#
#  These are old and very obsolete laptop computers,
#+ but this particular script is very instructive,
#+ as it shows how to set up and hack device files.



#  Search for sound card pnp device:

for dev in /sys/bus/pnp/devices/*
do
  grep CSC0100 $dev/id > /dev/null && WSSDEV=$dev
  grep CSC0110 $dev/id > /dev/null && CTLDEV=$dev
done
# On 770x:
# WSSDEV = /sys/bus/pnp/devices/00:07
# CTLDEV = /sys/bus/pnp/devices/00:06
# These are symbolic links to /sys/devices/pnp0/ ...


#  Activate devices:
#  Thinkpad boots with devices disabled unless "fast boot" is turned off
#+ (in BIOS).

echo activate > $WSSDEV/resources
echo activate > $CTLDEV/resources


# Parse resource settings.

{ read # Discard "state = active" (see below).
  read bla port1
  read bla port2
  read bla port3
  read bla irq
  read bla dma1
  read bla dma2
 # The "bla's" are labels in the first field: "io," "state," etc.
 # These are discarded.

 #  Hack: with PnPBIOS: ports are: port1: WSS, port2:
 #+ OPL, port3: sb (unneeded)
 #       with ACPI-PnP:ports are: port1: OPL, port2: sb, port3: WSS
 #  (ACPI bios seems to be wrong here, the PnP-card-code in snd-cs4236.c
 #+  uses the PnPBIOS port order)
 #  Detect port order using the fixed OPL port as reference.
  if [ ${port2%%-*} = 0x388 ]
 #            ^^^^  Strip out everything following hyphen in port address.
 #                  So, if port1 is 0x530-0x537
 #+                 we're left with 0x530 -- the start address of the port.
 then
   # PnPBIOS: usual order
   port=${port1%%-*}
   oplport=${port2%%-*}
 else
   # ACPI: mixed-up order
   port=${port3%%-*}
   oplport=${port1%%-*}
 fi
 } < $WSSDEV/resources

#
#   state = active
#   io 0x530-0x537
#   io 0x388-0x38b
#   io 0x220-0x233
#   irq 5
#   dma 1
#   dma 0
#   ^^^   "bla" labels in first field (discarded). 


{ read # Discard first line, as above.
  read bla port1
  cport=${port1%%-*}
  #            ^^^^
  # Just want _start_ address of port.
} < $CTLDEV/resources


# Load the module:

modprobe --ignore-install snd-cs4236 port=$port cport=$cport\
fm_port=$oplport irq=$irq dma1=$dma1 dma2=$dma2 isapnp=0 index=0
# See the modprobe manpage.

exit $?

**Example A-35.** Locating split paragraphs in a text file

```bash

#+ and tags the line numbers.


ARGCOUNT=1       # Expect one arg.
OFF=0            # Flag states.

then
  echo "Usage: `basename $0` FILENAME"
  exit $E_WRONGARGS
fi  

file_read ()     # Scan file for pattern, then print line.

do

  if [[ "$line" =~ ^[a-z] && $Flag -eq $ON ]]
     then  # Line begins with lowercase character, following blank line.
     echo -n "$lineno::   "
     echo "$line"
  fi


  if [[ "$line" =~ ^$ ]]
     then       #  If blank line,
     Flag=$ON   #+ set flag.
  else
     Flag=$OFF
  fi

  ((lineno++))

done
} < $file  # Redirect file into function's stdin.

file_read


exit $?


# ----------------------------------------------------------------
This is line one of an example paragraph, bla, bla, bla.
This is line two, and line three should follow on next line, but

there is a blank line separating the two parts of the paragraph.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------

Running this script on a file containing the above paragraph
yields:

4::   there is a blank line separating the two parts of the paragraph.


There will be additional output for all the other split paragraphs
in the target file.

**Example A-37.** Standard Deviation

```bash

# sd.sh: Standard Deviation

#  The Standard Deviation indicates how consistent a set of data is.
#  It shows to what extent the individual data points deviate from the
#+ arithmetic mean, i.e., how much they "bounce around" (or cluster).
#  It is essentially the average deviation-distance of the
#+ data points from the mean.

# =========================================================== #
#    To calculate the Standard Deviation:
#
# 1  Find the arithmetic mean (average) of all the data points.
# 2  Subtract each data point from the arithmetic mean,
#    and square that difference.
# 3  Add all of the individual difference-squares in # 2.
# 4  Divide the sum in # 3 by the number of data points.
#    This is known as the "variance."
# 5  The square root of # 4 gives the Standard Deviation.

#  Note that the generated man page will usually

#  The main deficiency of the script is that it permits
#+ pasting only a single text line into the input fields.
#  This may be a long, cobbled-together line, which groff
#  will automatically wrap and hyphenate.
#  However, if you want multiple (newline-separated) paragraphs,
#+ these must be inserted by manual text editing on the
#+ script-generated man page.
#  Exercise (difficult): Fix this!

#  This script is not nearly as elaborate as the
#+ full-featured "manedit" package
#+ http://freshmeat.net/projects/manedit/
#+ but it's much easier to use.

The name of the game is Petals Around the Rose,
and that name is significant.
Five dice will roll and you must guess the "answer" for each roll.
It will be zero or an even number.
After your guess, you will be told the answer for the roll, but . . .
that's ALL the information you will get.

Six consecutive correct guesses admits you to the
Fellowship of the Rose.

QUACKEY is a variant of Perquackey [TM].
The rules are the same, but the scoring is simplified
and plurals of previously played words are allowed.
"Vulnerable" play is not yet implemented,
but it is otherwise feature-complete.

As the game begins, the player gets 10 letters.
The object is to construct valid dictionary words
of at least 3-letter length from the letterset.
Each word-length category
-- 3-letter, 4-letter, 5-letter, ... --
fills up with the fifth word entered,
and no further words in that category are accepted.

The penalty for too-short (two-letter), duplicate, unconstructable,
and invalid (not in dictionary) words is -200. The same penalty applies
to attempts to enter a word in a filled-up category.

INSTRUCTION1

  echo -n "Hit ENTER for next page of instructions. "; read az1

     cat <<INSTRUCTION2

The scoring mostly corresponds to classic Perquackey:
The first 3-letter word scores    60, plus   10 for each additional one.
The first 4-letter word scores   120, plus   20 for each additional one.
The first 5-letter word scores   200, plus   50 for each additional one.
The first 6-letter word scores   300, plus  100 for each additional one.
The first 7-letter word scores   500, plus  150 for each additional one.
The first 8-letter word scores   750, plus  250 for each additional one.
The first 9-letter word scores  1000, plus  500 for each additional one.
The first 10-letter word scores 2000, plus 2000 for each additional one.

Category completion bonuses are:
3-letter words   100
4-letter words   200
5-letter words   400
6-letter words   800
7-letter words  2000
8-letter words 10000
This is a simplification of the absurdly baroque Perquackey bonus
scoring system.

INSTRUCTION2

  echo -n "Hit ENTER for final page of instructions. "; read az1

     cat <<INSTRUCTION3


Hitting just ENTER for a word entry ends the game.

Individual word entry is timed to a maximum of 10 seconds.
*** Timing out on an entry ends the game. ***
Aside from that, the game is untimed.

--------------------------------------------------
Game statistics are automatically saved to a file.
--------------------------------------------------

For competitive ("duplicate") play, a previous letterset
may be duplicated by repeating the script's random seed,
command-line parameter \$1.
For example, "qky 7633" specifies the letterset 
c a d i f r h u s k ...

     cat <<INSTRUCTIONS

Nim is a game with roots in the distant past.
This particular variant starts with five rows of pegs.

1:    | | | | | 
2:     | | | | 
3:      | | | 
4:       | | 
5:        | 

The number at the left identifies the row.

The human player moves first, and alternates turns with the bot.
A turn consists of removing at least one peg from a single row.
It is permissable to remove ALL the pegs from a row.
For example, in row 2, above, the player can remove 1, 2, 3, or 4 pegs.
The player who removes the last peg loses.

The strategy consists of trying to be the one who removes

# Improve the bot's strategy.
# There is, in fact, a Nim strategy that can force a win.
# See the Wikipedia article on Nim:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim
# Recode the bot to use this strategy (rather difficult).

#  Curiosities:
#  -----------
#  Nim played a prominent role in Alain Resnais' 1961 New Wave film,
#+ Last Year at Marienbad.
#
#  In 1978, Leo Christopherson wrote an animated version of Nim,
#+ Android Nim, for the TRS-80 Model I.

# A command-line Stopwatch

# Author: P�draig Brady
#    http://www.pixelbeat.org/scripts/sw
#    (Minor reformatting by ABS Guide author.)
#    Used in ABS Guide with script author's permission.
# Notes:
#    This script starts a few processes per lap, in addition to
#    the shell loop processing, so the assumption is made that
#    this takes an insignificant amount of time compared to
#    the response time of humans (~.1s) (or the keyboard
#    interrupt rate (~.05s)).
#    '?' for splits must be entered twice if characters
#    (erroneously) entered before it (on the same line).
#    '?' since not generating a signal may be slightly delayed
#    on heavily loaded systems.
#    Lap timings on ubuntu may be slightly delayed due to:
#    https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/62511
# Changes:
#    V1.0, 23 Aug 2005, Initial release
#    V1.1, 26 Jul 2007, Allow both splits and laps from single invocation.
#                       Only start timer after a key is pressed.
#                       Indicate lap number
#                       Cache programs at startup so there is less error
#                       due to startup delays.
#    V1.2, 01 Aug 2007, Work around `date` commands that don't have
#                       nanoseconds.
#                       Use stty to change interrupt keys to space for
#                       laps etc.
#                       Ignore other input as it causes problems.
#    V1.3, 01 Aug 2007, Testing release.
#    V1.4, 02 Aug 2007, Various tweaks to get working under ubuntu
#                       and Mac OS X.
#    V1.5, 27 Jun 2008, set LANG=C as got vague bug report about it.

#             The Knight's Tour, a classic problem.               #
#             =====================================               #
#  The knight must move onto every square of the chess board,     #
#  but cannot revisit any square he has already visited.          #
#                                                                 #
#  And just why is Sir Knight unwelcome for a return visit?       #
#  Could it be that he has a habit of partying into the wee hours #
#+ of the morning?                                                #
#  Possibly he leaves pizza crusts in the bed, empty beer bottles #
#+ all over the floor, and clogs the plumbing. . . .              #

# Exercises:
# ---------
#
# 1) Extend this example to a 10 x 10 board or larger.
# 2) Improve the "stupid strategy" by modifying the
#    do_move_stupid function.
#    Hint: Prevent straying into corner squares in early moves
#          (the exact opposite of Warnsdorff's algorithm!).
# 3) This script could stand considerable improvement and
#    streamlining, especially in the poorly-written
#    generate_moves() function
#    and in the DECIDE-MOVE patch in the do_move() function.
#    Must figure out why standard algorithm fails for startpos=37 ...
#+   but _not_ on any other, including symmetrical startpos=26.
#    Possibly, when calculating possible moves, counts the move back
#+   to the originating square. If so, it might be a relatively easy fix.

# A C-program by the very talented Kwon Young Shin inspired this script.
#     http://user.chollian.net/~brainstm/MagicSquare.htm

# Definition: A "magic square" is a two-dimensional array
#             of integers in which all the rows, columns,
#             and *long* diagonals add up to the same number.
#             Being "square," the array has the same number
#             of rows and columns. That number is the "order."
# An example of a magic square of order 3 is:
#   8  1  6   
#   3  5  7   
#   4  9  2   
# All the rows, columns, and the two long diagonals add up to 15.

# Exercises:
# ---------
# 1) Add a function to calculate the sum of each row, column,

#    This is the "magic constant" of that particular order square.
# 2) Have the print_square function auto-calculate how much space
#    to allot between square elements for optimized display.
#    This might require parameterizing the "printf" line.
# 3) Add appropriate functions for generating magic squares
#    with an *even* number of rows/columns.
#    This is non-trivial(!).

#  Most of the following points are described at length in
#+ the text of the foregoing "Advanced Bash Scripting Guide."
#  This demonstration script is mostly just a reorganized presentation.
#      -- msz

# Variables are not typed unless otherwise specified.

#  Variables are named. Names must contain a non-digit.
#  File descriptor names (as in, for example: 2>&1)
#+ contain ONLY digits.

# Parameters and Bash array elements are numbered.
# (Parameters are very similar to Bash arrays.)

# A variable name may be undefined (null reference).
unset VarNull

# A variable name may be defined but empty (null contents).
VarEmpty=''                         # Two, adjacent, single quotes.

# A variable name may be defined and non-empty.
VarSomething='Literal'

# A variable may contain:
#   * A whole number as a signed 32-bit (or larger) integer
#   * A string
# A variable may also be an array.

#  A string may contain embedded blanks and may be treated
#+ as if it where a function name with optional arguments.

#  The names of variables and the names of functions
#+ are in different namespaces.


#  A variable may be defined as a Bash array either explicitly or
#+ implicitly by the syntax of the assignment statement.
#  Explicit:
declare -a ArrayVar



# The echo command is a builtin.
echo $VarSomething

# The printf command is a builtin.
# Translate %s as: String-Format
printf %s $VarSomething         # No linebreak specified, none output.
echo                            # Default, only linebreak output.




# The Bash parser word breaks on whitespace.
# Whitespace, or the lack of it is significant.
# (This holds true in general; there are, of course, exceptions.)




# Translate the DOLLAR_SIGN character as: Content-Of.

# Extended-Syntax way of writing Content-Of:
echo ${VarSomething}

#  The ${ ... } Extended-Syntax allows more than just the variable
#+ name to be specified.
#  In general, $VarSomething can always be written as: ${VarSomething}.

# Call this script with arguments to see the following in action.



#  Outside of double-quotes, the special characters @ and *
#+ specify identical behavior.
#  May be pronounced as: All-Elements-Of.

#  Without specification of a name, they refer to the
#+ pre-defined parameter Bash-Array.



# Glob-Pattern references
echo $*                         # All parameters to script or function
echo ${*}                       # Same

# Bash disables filename expansion for Glob-Patterns.
# Only character matching is active.


# All-Elements-Of references
echo $@                         # Same as above
echo ${@}                       # Same as above




#  Within double-quotes, the behavior of Glob-Pattern references
#+ depends on the setting of IFS (Input Field Separator).
#  Within double-quotes, All-Elements-Of references behave the same.


#  Specifying only the name of a variable holding a string refers
#+ to all elements (characters) of a string.


#  To specify an element (character) of a string,
#+ the Extended-Syntax reference notation (see below) MAY be used.




#  Specifying only the name of a Bash array references
#+ the subscript zero element,
#+ NOT the FIRST DEFINED nor the FIRST WITH CONTENTS element.

#  Additional qualification is needed to reference other elements,
#+ which means that the reference MUST be written in Extended-Syntax.
#  The general form is: ${name[subscript]}.

#  The string forms may also be used: ${name:subscript}
#+ for Bash-Arrays when referencing the subscript zero element.


# Bash-Arrays are implemented internally as linked lists,
#+ not as a fixed area of storage as in some programming languages.


#   Characteristics of Bash arrays (Bash-Arrays):
#   --------------------------------------------

#   If not otherwise specified, Bash-Array subscripts begin with
#+  subscript number zero. Literally: [0]
#   This is called zero-based indexing.
###
#   If not otherwise specified, Bash-Arrays are subscript packed
#+  (sequential subscripts without subscript gaps).
###
#   Negative subscripts are not allowed.
###
#   Elements of a Bash-Array need not all be of the same type.
###
#   Elements of a Bash-Array may be undefined (null reference).
#       That is, a Bash-Array may be "subscript sparse."
###
#   Elements of a Bash-Array may be defined and empty (null contents).
###
#   Elements of a Bash-Array may contain:
#     * A whole number as a signed 32-bit (or larger) integer
#     * A string
#     * A string formated so that it appears to be a function name
#     + with optional arguments
###
#   Defined elements of a Bash-Array may be undefined (unset).
#       That is, a subscript packed Bash-Array may be changed
#   +   into a subscript sparse Bash-Array.
###
#   Elements may be added to a Bash-Array by defining an element
#+  not previously defined.
###
# For these reasons, I have been calling them "Bash-Arrays".
# I'll return to the generic term "array" from now on.

# Put IFS back to the default.

# Interpretation of the above outputs:

###
#   An All-Elements-Of does not consider IFS settings.
###
#   Note the different output using the echo command and the
#+  quoted format operator of the printf command.


#  Recall:
#   Parameters are similar to arrays and have the similar behaviors.
###
#  The above examples demonstrate the possible variations.
#  To retain the shape of a sparse array, additional script
#+ programming is required.
###
#  The source code of Bash has a routine to output the
#+ [subscript]=value   array assignment format.

echo
echo 'Defined content count: '${#ArrayVar[@]}' elements.'
# That is NOT the maximum subscript (4).
# That is NOT the range of the subscripts (1 . . 4 inclusive).
# It IS the length of the linked list.

#+ be found with additional script programming.

# REVIEW:
# ------

#  A string can be considered a Classic-Array of elements (characters).
#  A string operation applies to all elements (characters) of the string
#+ (in concept, anyway).
###
#  The notation: ${array_name[@]} represents all elements of the
#+ Bash-Array: array_name.
###
#  The Extended-Syntax string operations can be applied to all
#+ elements of an array.
###
#  This may be thought of as a For-Each operation on a vector of strings.
###
#  Parameters are similar to an array.
#  The initialization of a parameter array for a script
#+ and a parameter array for a function only differ
#+ in the initialization of ${0}, which never changes its setting.
###
#  Subscript zero of the script's parameter array contains
#+ the name of the script.
###
#  Subscript zero of a function's parameter array DOES NOT contain
#+ the name of the function.
#  The name of the current function is accessed by the $FUNCNAME variable.
###
#  A quick, review list follows (quick, not short).

###
#  Note:
#  The "read -a array_name" version of the "read" command
#+ begins filling array_name at subscript zero.
#  ArraySparse does not define a value at subscript zero.
###
