title: Appendix T. ASCII Table
---


Traditionally, a book of this sort has an [[special-characters#^ASCIIDEF|ASCII]] Table appendix. This book does not. Instead, here are several short scripts, each of which generates a complete ASCII table.

![[Example T-1|Example T-1]]

![[Example T-2|Example T-2]]

![[Example T-3|Example T-3]]
