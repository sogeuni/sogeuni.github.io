> If you need assistance with a schoolwork assignment, read the pertinent sections of this and other reference works. Do your best to solve the problem using your own wits and resources. _Please do not waste the author's time._ You will get neither help nor sympathy. [^1]

> Likewise, kindly refrain from annoying the author with solicitations, offers of employment, or "business opportunities." He is doing just fine, and requires neither help nor sympathy, thank you.

> Please note that the author will _not_ answer scripting questions for Sun/Solaris/Oracle or Apple systems. The endarkened execs and the arachnoid corporate attorneys of those particular outfits have been using litigation in a predatory manner and/or as a weapon against the Open Source Community. Any Solaris or Apple users needing scripting help will therefore kindly direct their concerns to corporate customer service.
