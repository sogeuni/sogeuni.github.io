title: 38.2. About the Author

Who is this guy anyhow?

The author claims no credentials or special qualifications, [^1] other than a compulsion to write. [^2]

This book is somewhat of a departure from his other major work, [HOW-2 Meet Women: The Shy Man's Guide to Relationships](http://bash.deta.in/hmw60.zip). He has also written the [Software-Building HOWTO](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Building-HOWTO.html). Of late, he has been trying his (heavy) hand at fiction: [Dave Dawson Over Berlin (First Installment)](http://bash.deta.in/dave-dawson-over-berlin.epub) [Dave Dawson Over Berlin (Second Installment)](http://bash.deta.in/dave-dawson-over-berlin.II.epub) and [Dave Dawson Over Berlin (Third Installment)](http://bash.deta.in/dave-dawson-over-berlin.III.epub) . He also has a few _Instructables_ ([here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Morse-Code-Shield/), [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Haywired-Hackduino/), [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-DIY-SD-Card-Logging-Shield/), [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Binguino-An-Arduino-based-Bingo-Number-Generato/), [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Raspberry-Pi-Lapdock-Connection/), [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Raspberry-Pi-Arduino-Connection/), and [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Switchable-Dual-Voltage-33v5v-Hacduino/) to his (dis)credit.

A Linux user since 1995 (Slackware 2.2, kernel 1.2.1), the author has emitted a few software truffles, including the [cruft](http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/file/cruft-0.2.tar.gz) one-time pad encryption utility, the [mcalc](http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/apps/financial/mcalc-1.6.tar.gz) mortgage calculator, the [judge](http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/games/amusements/judge-1.0.tar.gz) ScrabbleÂ® adjudicator, the [yawl](http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/libs/yawl-0.3.2.tar.gz) word gaming list package, and the [Quacky](http://bash.deta.in/qky.README.html) anagramming gaming package. He got off to a rather shaky start in the computer game -- programming FORTRAN IV on a CDC 3800 (on paper coding pads, with occasional forays on a keypunch machine and a Friden Flexowriter) -- and is not the least bit nostalgic for those days.

Living in an out-of-the-way community with wife and orange tabby, he cherishes human frailty, especially his own. [^3]

[^1]: In fact, he has no credentials or special qualifications. He's a school dropout with no formal credentials or professional experience whatsoever. None. Zero. Nada. Aside from the _ABS Guide_, his major claim to fame is a First Place in the sack race at the Colfax Elementary School Field Day in June, 1958.

[^2]: Those who can, do. Those who can't . . . get an MCSE.

[^3]: Sometimes it seems as if he has spent his entire life flouting conventional wisdom and defying the sonorous Voice of Authority: "_Hey, you can't do that!_"
