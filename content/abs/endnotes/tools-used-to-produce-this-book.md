title: 38.4. Tools Used to Produce This Book
---


## 38.4.1. Hardware

A used IBM Thinkpad, model 760XL laptop (P166, 104 meg RAM) running Red Hat 7.1/7.3. Sure, it's slow and has a funky keyboard, but it beats the heck out of a No. 2 pencil and a Big Chief tablet.

_Update:_ upgraded to a 770Z Thinkpad (P2-366, 192 meg RAM) running FC3. Anyone feel like donating a later-model laptop to a starving writer \<g>?

_Update:_ upgraded to a T61 Thinkpad running Mandriva 2011. No longer starving \<g>, but not too proud to accept donations.

## 38.4.2. Software and Printware

1. Bram Moolenaar's powerful SGML-aware [vim](http://www.vim.org) text editor.
2. [OpenJade](http://www.netfolder.com/DSSSL/), a DSSSL rendering engine for converting SGML documents into other formats.
3. [Norman Walsh's DSSSL stylesheets](http://nwalsh.com/docbook/dsssl/).
4. _DocBook, The Definitive Guide_, by Norman Walsh and Leonard Muellner (O'Reilly, ISBN 1-56592-580-7). This is still the standard reference for anyone attempting to write a document in Docbook SGML format.
