title: 12. Command Substitution
---


**Command substitution** reassigns the output of a command [^1] or even multiple commands; it literally plugs the command output into another context. [^2]

The classic form of command substitution uses _backquotes_ (\`...\`). Commands within backquotes (backticks) generate command-line text.

```bash
script_name=`basename $0`
echo "The name of this script is $script_name."
```

**The output of commands can be used as arguments to another command, to set a variable, and even for generating the argument list in a [[loops-and-branches#^FORLOOPREF1|for]] loop.**

```bash
rm `cat filename`   # "filename" contains a list of files to delete.
#
# S. C. points out that "arg list too long" error might result.
# Better is              xargs rm -- < filename 
# ( -- covers those cases where "filename" begins with a "-" )

textfile_listing=`ls *.txt`
# Variable contains names of all *.txt files in current working directory.
echo $textfile_listing

textfile_listing2=$(ls *.txt)   # The alternative form of command substitution.
echo $textfile_listing2
# Same result.

# A possible problem with putting a list of files into a single string
# is that a newline may creep in.
#
# A safer way to assign a list of files to a parameter is with an array.
#      shopt -s nullglob    # If no match, filename expands to nothing.
#      textfile_listing=( *.txt )
#
# Thanks, S.C.
```

Command substitution even permits setting a variable to the contents of a file, using either [[io-redirection|redirection]] or the [[basic-commands#^CATREF|cat]] command.

```bash
variable1=`<file1`      #  Set "variable1" to contents of "file1".
variable2=`cat file2`   #  Set "variable2" to contents of "file2".
                        #  This, however, forks a new process,
                        #+ so the line of code executes slower than the above version.

#  Note that the variables may contain embedded whitespace,
#+ or even (horrors), control characters.

#  It is not necessary to explicitly assign a variable.
echo "` <$0`"           # Echoes the script itself to stdout.
```

```bash
#  Excerpts from system file, /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit
#+ (on a Red Hat Linux installation)


if [ -f /fsckoptions ]; then
        fsckoptions=`cat /fsckoptions`
...
fi
#
#
if [ -e "/proc/ide/${disk[$device]}/media" ] ; then
             hdmedia=`cat /proc/ide/${disk[$device]}/media`
...
fi
#
#
if [ ! -n "`uname -r | grep -- "-"`" ]; then
       ktag="`cat /proc/version`"
...
fi
#
#
if [ $usb = "1" ]; then
    sleep 5
    mouseoutput=`cat /proc/bus/usb/devices 2>/dev/null|grep -E "^I.*Cls=03.*Prot=02"`
    kbdoutput=`cat /proc/bus/usb/devices 2>/dev/null|grep -E "^I.*Cls=03.*Prot=01"`
...
fi
```

Command substitution permits setting a variable to the output of a [[loops-and-branches#^FORLOOPREF1|loop]]. The key to this is grabbing the output of an [[internal-commands-and-builtins#^ECHOREF|echo]] command within the loop.

###### Example 12-2. Generating a variable from a loop

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# csubloop.sh: Setting a variable to the output of a loop.

variable1=`for i in 1 2 3 4 5
do
  echo -n "$i"                 #  The 'echo' command is critical
done`                          #+ to command substitution here.

echo "variable1 = $variable1"  # variable1 = 12345


i=0
variable2=`while [ "$i" -lt 10 ]
do
  echo -n "$i"                 # Again, the necessary 'echo'.
  let "i += 1"                 # Increment.
done`

echo "variable2 = $variable2"  # variable2 = 0123456789

#  Demonstrates that it's possible to embed a loop
#+ inside a variable declaration.

exit 0
```

> Command substitution makes it possible to extend the toolset available to Bash. It is simply a matter of writing a program or script that outputs to stdout (like a well-behaved UNIX tool should) and assigning that output to a variable.

[^1]: For purposes of _command substitution_, a **command** may be an external system command, an internal scripting [[internal-commands-and-builtins|builtin]], or even [[assorted-tips#^RVT|a script function]].

[^2]: In a more technically correct sense, _command substitution_ extracts the stdout of a command, then assigns it to a variable using the = operator.

[^3]: In fact, nesting with backticks is also possible, but only by escaping the inner backticks, as John Default points out.

    ```bash
    word_count=` wc -w \`echo * | awk '{print $8}'\` `
    ```
