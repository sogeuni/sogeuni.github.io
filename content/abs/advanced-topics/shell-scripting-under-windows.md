title: 36.10. Shell Scripting Under Windows
---


Even users running _that other_ OS can run UNIX-like shell scripts, and therefore benefit from many of the lessons of this book. The [Cygwin]([http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/) package from Cygnus and the [MKS utilities](http://www.mkssoftware.com/) from Mortice Kern Associates add shell scripting capabilities to Windows.

Another alternative is [UWIN](http://www2.research.att.com/~gsf/download/uwin/uwin.html), written by David Korn of AT&T, of [[bibliography#^KORNSHELLREF|Korn Shell]] fame.

In 2006, Microsoft released the Windows PowershellÂ®, which contains limited Bash-like command-line scripting capabilities.
