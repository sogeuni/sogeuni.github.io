title: 26. List Constructs
---


The _and list_ and _or list_ constructs provide a means of processing a number of commands consecutively. These can effectively replace complex nested [[testconstructs.html#TESTCONSTRUCTS1|if/then]] or even [[testbranch.html#CASEESAC1|case]] statements.

**Chaining together commands**

and list

```bash
command-1 && command-2 && command-3 && ... command-n
```

Each command executes in turn, provided that the previous command has given a return value of _true_ (zero). At the first _false_ (non-zero) return, the command chain terminates (the first command returning _false_ is the last one to execute).

An interesting use of a two-condition _and list_ from an early version of YongYe's [Tetris game script](http://bash.deta.in/Tetris_Game.sh):

```bash
equation()

{  # core algorithm used for doubling and halving the coordinates
   [[ ${cdx} ]] && ((y=cy+(ccy-cdy)${2}2))
   eval ${1}+=\"${x} ${y} \"
}
```

**Example 26-1.** Using an *and list* to test for command-line arguments

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# and list

if [ ! -z "$1" ] && echo "Argument #1 = $1" && [ ! -z "$2" ] && \
#                ^^                         ^^               ^^
echo "Argument #2 = $2"
then
  echo "At least 2 arguments passed to script."
  # All the chained commands return true.
else
  echo "Fewer than 2 arguments passed to script."
  # At least one of the chained commands returns false.
fi  
# Note that "if [ ! -z $1 ]" works, but its alleged equivalent,
#   "if [ -n $1 ]" does not.
#     However, quoting fixes this.
#  if "[ -n "$1" ]" works.
#           ^  ^    Careful!
# It is always best to QUOTE the variables being tested.


# This accomplishes the same thing, using "pure" if/then statements.
if [ ! -z "$1" ]
then
  echo "Argument #1 = $1"
fi
if [ ! -z "$2" ]
then
  echo "Argument #2 = $2"
  echo "At least 2 arguments passed to script."
else
  echo "Fewer than 2 arguments passed to script."
fi
# It's longer and more ponderous than using an "and list".


exit $?
```

**Example 26-2.** Another command-line arg test using an *and list*

```bash
#!/bin/bash

ARGS=1        # Number of arguments expected.
E_BADARGS=85  # Exit value if incorrect number of args passed.

test $# -ne $ARGS && \
#    ^^^^^^^^^^^^ condition #1
echo "Usage: `basename $0` $ARGS argument(s)" && exit $E_BADARGS
#                                             ^^
#  If condition #1 tests true (wrong number of args passed to script),
#+ then the rest of the line executes, and script terminates.

# Line below executes only if the above test fails.
echo "Correct number of arguments passed to this script."

exit 0

# To check exit value, do a "echo $?" after script termination.
```

Of course, an _and list_ can also _set_ variables to a default value.

```bash
arg1=$@ && [ -z "$arg1" ] && arg1=DEFAULT
        
              # Set $arg1 to command-line arguments, if any.
              # But . . . set to DEFAULT if not specified on command-line.
```

or list

```bash
command-1 | command-2 | command-3 | ... command-n
```

Each command executes in turn for as long as the previous command returns false. At the first true return, the command chain terminates (the first command returning true is the last one to execute). This is obviously the inverse of the "and list".

**Example 26-3.** Using _or lists_ in combination with an *and list*

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#  delete.sh, a not-so-cunning file deletion utility.
#  Usage: delete filename

E_BADARGS=85

if [ -z "$1" ]
then
  echo "Usage: `basename $0` filename"
  exit $E_BADARGS  # No arg? Bail out.
else  
  file=$1          # Set filename.
fi  


[ ! -f "$file" ] && echo "File \"$file\" not found. \
Cowardly refusing to delete a nonexistent file."
# AND LIST, to give error message if file not present.
# Note echo message continuing on to a second line after an escape.

[ ! -f "$file" ] | (rm -f $file; echo "File \"$file\" deleted.")
# OR LIST, to delete file if present.

# Note logic inversion above.
# AND LIST executes on true, OR LIST on false.

exit $?
```

  #+==> then "continue" by jumping to the top of the loop.

        case "$1" in
                *.rpmsave|*.rpmorig|*.rpmnew|*~|*.orig)
                        continue;;
        esac
        [ "$i" = "/etc/rc1.d/S00single" ] && continue
  # ==> Set script name, but don't execute it yet.
        $i start
done

  # ==> . . .

Clever combinations of _and_ and _or_ lists are possible, but the logic may easily become convoluted and require close attention to [[operations-and-related-topics#^OPPRECEDENCE1|operator precedence rules]], and possibly extensive debugging.

```bash
false && true | echo false         # false

# Same result as
( false && true ) | echo false     # false
# But NOT
false && ( true | echo false )     # (nothing echoed)

#  Note left-to-right grouping and evaluation of statements.

#  It's usually best to avoid such complexities.

#  Thanks, S.C.
