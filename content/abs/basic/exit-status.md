The **exit** command terminates a script, just as in a **C** program. It can also return a value, which is available to the script's parent process.

Every command returns an _exit status_ (sometimes referred to as a _return status_ or _exit code_). A successful command returns a 0, while an unsuccessful one returns a non-zero value that usually can be interpreted as an _error code_. Well-behaved UNIX commands, programs, and utilities return a 0 exit code upon successful completion, though there are some exceptions.

Likewise, [[functions|functions]] within a script and the script itself return an exit status. The last command executed in the function or script determines the exit status. Within a script, an **exit _nnn_** command may be used to deliver an _nnn_ exit status to the shell (_nnn_ must be an integer in the 0 - 255 range).

> [!note]
> When a script ends with an **exit** that has no parameter, the exit status of the script is the exit status of the last command executed in the script (previous to the **exit**).

`$?` reads the exit status of the last command executed. After a function returns, `$?` gives the exit status of the last command executed in the function. This is Bash's way of giving functions a "return value." [^1]

Following the execution of a [[special-characters#^PIPEREF|pipe]], a $? gives the exit status of the last command executed.

After a script terminates, a $? from the command-line gives the exit status of the script, that is, the last command executed in the script, which is, by convention, **0** on success or an integer in the range 1 - 255 on error.

###### Example 6-1. exit / exit status

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo hello
echo $?    # Exit status 0 returned because command executed successfully.

lskdf      # Unrecognized command.
echo $?    # Non-zero exit status returned -- command failed to execute.

echo

exit 113   # Will return 113 to shell.
           # To verify this, type "echo $?" after script terminates.

#  By convention, an 'exit 0' indicates success,
#+ while a non-zero exit value means an error or anomalous condition.
#  See the "Exit Codes With Special Meanings" appendix.
```

[[another-look-at-variables#^XSTATVARREF|$?]] is especially useful for testing the result of a command in a script (see [[file-and-archiving-commands#^FILECOMP|Example 16-35]] and [[text-processing-commands#^LOOKUP|Example 16-20]]).

> [!note] The [[special-characters#^NOTREF|!]], the _logical not_ qualifier, reverses the outcome of a test or command, and this affects its [[exit-and-exit-status#^EXITSTATUSREF|exit status]].

> ! true

> !true
> # No error this time, but no negation either.
> # It just repeats the previous command (true).

> [!caution] Certain exit status codes have [[exit-codes-with-special-meanings#^EXITCODESREF|reserved meanings]] and should not be user-specified in a script.

[^1]: In those instances when there is no [[complex-functions-and-function-complexities#^RETURNREF|return]] terminating the function.
